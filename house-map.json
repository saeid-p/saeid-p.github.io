You may rise quickly in your profession or attract public attention, but the journey is rarely linear. You're here to carve your own path, often breaking free from traditional career norms. However, the karmic lesson is to pursue your ambitions with integrity. There may be temptations to manipulate, cut corners, or obsess over status. True growth comes from using your power and influence responsibly, not merely to feed the ego. Leadership may come naturally, but with it comes responsibility.

You are being called to develop inner stability and emotional independence, learning that true peace comes from within rather than from external circumstances. There may be karmic instability in family dynamics, frequent changes in your sense of \"home,\" or unexpected shifts in property matters. This placement may also affect your relationship with your mother, creating emotional distance or a sense of detachment that ultimately invites healing and inner work. You may be inclined to work overseas, travel or live far from your place of origin. This physical distance mirrors the emotional and karmic distance you're learning to navigate—guiding you to seek a deeper sense of belonging that transcends location or external stability.
